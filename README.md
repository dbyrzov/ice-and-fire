# IceAndFire - Fullstack Project (Frontend - Angular, Backend - Node.js)

This project is a full-stack application with the **frontend** built using **Angular** and the **backend** using **Node.js**. The backend serves APIs for auth and store inmemory data like users, favorite and etc, while the frontend communicates with both the backend and **https://anapioficeandfire.com/api** API to display the data to the user.

## Project Structure

The project contains two main folders:

- `frontend/`: Contains the Angular application.
- `backend/`: Contains the Node.js API.
